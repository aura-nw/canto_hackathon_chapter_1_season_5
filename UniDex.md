# Problem

Perp dexs are quite limited on not only Canto, but other networks as well. Many perp dexs are also unsafe using untrusted oracles or simply bad practices.

## How does it work?

We use the same pool counter party model other places like forex brokers, GMX, DyDx, and others use. But, we can offer super flexible trading pairs due to not being restricted to just chainlink oracles.

If a trader has positive PnL and closes a trade, the pool loses money and the trader is paid
If a trader has negative PnL and closes a trade. the pool gains money and NOTE is taken from the traders position.
